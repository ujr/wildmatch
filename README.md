# Wildcard Pattern Matching

(The manual for the final version is
in [wildmatch.md](./wildmatch.md)).

It is a feature found in many pieces of software:
match a string against a pattern that can contain
“wildcards”, usually `?` and `*`.

- a `?` matches any single character
- a `*` matches any *sequence* of characters,
  including the empty sequence
- all other characters match themselves

For example, the pattern `*.txt` matches any string that
ends with `.txt`, and `?*` matches any string that consists
of at least one character.

How can wildcard matching be implemented?

## Recursive Matching

There is a simple recursive algorithm for matching
a pattern *pat* against a string *str* as follows.
Look at the first characters of both *pat* and *str*;
if both are `\0` then we successfully matched; else
if they do not match, we have a mismatch; otherwise
recurse over the tails of *pat* and *str*.

With no wildcards, this is just a recursive
implementation of string equality:

```C
bool rmatch(const char *pat, const char *str)
{
  if (*pat == 0) return *str == 0;
  if (*pat != *str) return false;
  return rmatch(pat+1, str+1);
}
```

Add support for the `?` wildcard; the `?` always
matches as long as *str* still has a character:

```C
bool rmatch(const char *pat, const char *str)
{
  if (*pat == 0) return *str == 0;
  if (*pat == '?') {
    if (*str == 0) return false;
  }
  else if (*pat != *str) return false;
  return rmatch(pat+1, str+1);
}
```

Add support for the `*` wildcard; if we are at a `*`
in the pattern, see if the remainder of the pattern
matches ever shorter suffixes (including the empty
suffix) of the remaining string.

```C
bool rmatch(const char *pat, const char *str)
{
  if (*pat == 0) return *str == 0;
  if (*pat == '*') {
    size_t i, n = strlen(str);
    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)
      if (rmatch(pat+1, str+i)) return true;
    return false;
  }
  if (*pat == '?') {
    if (*str == 0) return false;
  }
  else if (*pat != *str) return false;
  return rmatch(pat+1, str+1);
}
```

This implementation can be found in the
[recursive.c](./stages/recursive.c) file.

Recursion depth can get as deep as the string is long,
but no deeper. Still this is highly undesirable and
calls for an iterative implementation.

## Iterative Matching

Conceptually, the `*` wildcards cut the pattern into segments.
Each segment must match 1:1, whereas the `*` can “stretch” as
needed so as to find a match for the immediately following
segment (and not looking any farther).

If the initial segment (before the first `*`) does not match,
the whole pattern does not match.

If any of the following segments does not match, try
again but resume one character later in the string
(conceptually stretching the previous `*` by one character).

```C
bool imatch(const char *pat, const char *str)
{
  const char *p, *s;
  char pc, sc;

  p = s = 0;           // anchor initially not set

  for (;;) {
    pc = *pat++;
    if (pc == '*') {
      p = pat;         // set anchor just after wild star
      s = str;
      continue;
    }
    sc = *str++;
    if (sc == 0)
      return pc == 0 ? true : false;
    if (pc != '?' && pc != sc) {
      if (!p)
        return false;
      pat = p;         // resume at anchor in pattern
      str = ++s;       // but one later in string
      continue;
    }
  }
}
```

First `if` in the loop: when seeing a `*` in *pat*
this commits the current segment and we set an “anchor”
just after the `*` in *pat* (`p`) and at the current
location in *str* (`s`).

Last `if` in the loop: upon a mismatch, return to the
anchor in *pat* and one after the anchor in *str* and
try again. Here is room for optimization: e.g., after
matching `*abcX` against `abcZ`, resuming with `*abcX`
against `bcZ` is on the safe side, but if there is a
match, it must be after the `Z` in *str*.

In a sense, the “anchor” `p` and `s` implements a stack
of size one. This stack was implicit in the recursive
call in the previous solution.

Likely there are other algorithms, but the one above
was “stretchy” enough for my mind. An implementation can
be found in the [iterative1.c](./stages/iterative1.c) file.

## Bells and Whistles

- character classes like `[abc]`
- option to ignore case (case folding)
- path names: wildcards must not match `/` (the path separator)
- path names: new wildcard `**` that matches any number of directories
- hidden files: leading dot is only matched by leading dot
- utf-8: multibyte encoding, possibility for invalid encoding

### Character Classes

Pattern characters enclosed in squere brackets like `[abc]`
are known as character classes. They match any single character
from the class; all other characters to not match.
Two characters in a class separated by a dash like `0-9` denote
the range of all characters between the two. The extension depends
on the character set, but at least with ASCII, e.g. `[0-9A-Fa-f]`
denotes the set of all hex characters `0123456789ABCDEFabcdef`.
To include a literal dash in the character class, place it at
the very beginning of the very end of the class. If a character
class begins with a `!` (in some implementations also with a `^`),
then the class matches any single character *not* in the class.

A practical consideration is how to deal with unclosed character
classes like `[abc`. While an error is a possible solution, it is
probably more useful to treat such constructs as ordinary pattern
characters.
File [iterative2.c](./stages/iterative2.c) has an implementation.

### Ignoring Case

Ignoring case is sometimes useful, but not always, so this is an
option, `CASEFOLD`. It is implemented by folding upper case to
lower case (or vice versa) before comparison. An implementation
can be found in [iterative3.c](./stages/iterative3.c).

Two strategies: either, fold both pattern and string to, say,
lower case; or, compare original pattern against both upper'ed
and lower'ed string characters (one or the other must match).

### Path Name Specials

Wildcard pattern matching is most frequently used with file path
names, and in this case, it is more useful if the wildcards do
not match the directory separator (usually `/`): only a literal
`/` in the pattern can match a `/` in the string. For example,
we expect `*.txt` to match `file.txt`, but **not** to match
`../other/file.txt`. As with case folding, we make this an
option, `PATHNAME`, so the matching remains useful for other
applications.

Two strategies: either, modify the matching logic to look at
directory separators; or, match each path part separately.
The implementation in [iterative4.c](./stages/iterative4.c)
follows the first strategy.

```text
str:   abcxy       abc/xy    abc/xy         the tilde ~
pat:   *~~xy       *~~xy     *~~/xy         indicates the
                                            stretching of
      stretch     but cannot stretch        the asterisk
      to match    across dirsep (pat
                  fails at '/' vs 'x')
```

With the `PATHNAME` option, we can now only match a fixed
number of directory parts in a path, e.g. `foo/*/*/bar`
would match `foo/x/y/bar` but not `foo/x/y/z/bar`. It is
therefore useful to have a new wildcard `**` that matches
any number (including zero) of directories in a path.
Because `**` shall match entire directory parts, this
wildcard can only occur as `**/`, `/**/`, and `/**`.
This new wildcard is usually known as *globstar*, after
the like-named option in Bash; we may refer to the star
known previously as the *wildstar*.

Note that now more than one stretchable star can be “active”
at any time. For example, matching `**/a*` against `a/b/ab`,
the `**/` would have to be stretched from empty to `a/` to
`a/b/` before `a*` successfully can match `ab`. Our simple
iterative algorithm will fail, because the globstar's anchor
will be overwritten by the wildstar and we really only try
to match `a*` against `a/b/ab`, which fails.

To remedy this situation, we have to introduce an “anchor
stack” or – simpler — resort to recursion. The code in
[iterative4.c](./stages/iteraive4.c) does the latter.
Recursion depth is limited by the number of globstars
in the pattern.

Another complication concerns the slashes around a globstar:
for example, `x/**/y` must match `x/y` (one slash in string
but two slashes in pattern), and `**/x` must match `x` (no
slash in string, one slash in pattern). More than two stars
as in `x/***/y` shall be treated the same as two; and without
the `PATHNAME` option, two or more consecutive stars are
equivalent to just one.

Leading and trailing slashes as in `/**/x` or `x/**/` will
require a corresponding slash in the string; this is useful
to match absolute paths or directory paths (marked with a
trailing slash).

### Hidden Files

By convention, files with names starting with a period
(aka dot files) are hidden on Unix systems; for example, the
`ls` command does not list them unless they are explicitly
named (or a special option is specified).
It is useful for a wildcard match to have an option `PERIOD`
that makes it exhibit this same behaviour: an initial period
(at start of pattern or immediately following a slash) can
only be matched by a literal period in the pattern.
File [iterative5.c](./stages/iterative5.c) contains an implementation.

### UTF-8

The wildcard matcher so far compares bytes, not characters.
For single-byte character sets like ASCII this is no problem.
But nowadays, Unicode, encoded with UTF-8, is prevalent.
[UTF-8][utf8] encodes each Unicode character in one or more
bytes. For example, `A` is encoded as `41` hex (one byte),
and `€` is encoded as `E2 82 AC` hex (three bytes).

For matching literal characters, no changes are needed: UTF-8
just works. However, wildcards are supposed to match characters,
not bytes, so must *decode* byte(s) to a character.

This means we replace assignments like `pc = *pat++` by calls
to a UTF-8 decoding routine, and also the `str = ++s` assignments
must must be changed to consider the number of bytes of the
character at `s`. The back references `str[-2]` look suspicious,
but indeed can stay unchanged, because we know the two previous
characters have been encoded in one byte. Not any sequence of
bytes is a valid UTF-8 encoding, so the decoding routine may
signal an error; in this case it is probably best to skip
forward to the next byte in range 0..127, that is, the next
valid starting byte in the UTF-8 sequence; alternatively,
wildmatch could return an error flag (instead of true/false).

The decoding routine could have a signature similar to these

```c
int decode(void *buf, int *pc);
int decode(const unsigned char **ppz);
```

where the first writes the decoded character to `*pc` and
returns the number of bytes read, and the second returns
the decoded character and increments the pointer given.

An implementation can be found in the
[iterative6.c](./stages/iterative6.c) file.

## Comparison to Regular Expressions

Wildcard pattern matching is different from and simpler
than regular expression (regex) matching. Wildcard patterns
can be expressed as regex patterns (but not the other way):

- the wildcard `?` corresponds to the regex `.`
- the wildcard `*` corresponds to the regex `.*`
- the wildcard `[...]` corresponds to the regex `[...]`
- the wildcard `[!...]` corresponds to the regex `[^...]`

## Conclusion

Why write wildcard matching yourself? At least on Unix systems
there is a library method [fnmatch][fnmatch] that does the same
thing (though it does not usually support the `**` wildcard).
There is nothing wrong using it. You write it yourself
for some fun, insight, and your own bugs.

- Missing here is a performance evaluation.
- UTF-8 decoding should be improved and factored out

Wildcard matching is sometimes also known as glob matching,
after the ancient Unix tool */etc/glob* (short for global)
that did wildcard matching against the filesystem, before
this became built-in functionality of the shell.

The recursive algorithm presented here is commonplace.
The iterative algorithm was inspired by the one
by Kirk J. Krauss, presented as
[Matching Wildcards: An Algorithm][ddj] on August 26, 2008,
in (now discontinued) Dr. Dobbs Journal.

The final version of the algorithm is described in
[wildmatch.md](./wildmatch.md) and implemented in
[wildmatch.h](./wildmatch.h) and [wildmatch.c](./wildmatch.c).
